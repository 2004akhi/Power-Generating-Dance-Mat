This project is a smart, energy-harvesting dance mat that generates electricity using piezoelectric sensors embedded beneath its surface.
When someone steps or dances on the mat, the pressure from their movements is converted into electrical energy. 
The generated energy is then rectified, regulated, and either stored in a rechargeable battery or used to power small electronic devices.
An Arduino Uno microcontroller is used to measure the voltage output from the sensors and display it in real-time on an LCD screen.
The project is designed to promote sustainable energy solutions through interactive and engaging technology.
